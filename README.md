### Website [Wylie Web](http://rondawylie.com/)

This is the repo for my portfolio, it was my first project at DigitalCrafts.  I used flex boxes for the layout and kept it simple. 

### Technologies used:

JavaScript | jQuery | HTML | CSS

### Who I am:

Bilingual educator turned software developer. Book lover, passionate about technology, 
obsessed with learning new things, hard worker, and avid photographer. 

### How I got here:

Iâ€™ve seen how wonderful a new educational app can be to a student struggling to learn how to read. 
As a teacher I enjoyed learning about new apps and figuring out how to best implement them in the classroom. 
I began wishing I could build my own. After teaching in the classroom for 8 years I began looking into ways I 
could pursue a career in technology. This led me to sign up for several online sites like Code Academy, 
freeCodeCamp, and Team Tree House. 
I enjoy designing from scratch and creating something unique. 
The most satisfaction I get from programing is taking the time to figure out the solution to a problem, 
no matter how big or small it is. It's fun when you have the 'aha' moment.

### Education

I studied at DigitalCrafts. DigitalCrafts is a 16 week immersive bootcamp where students get hands on experience 
building web apps with instruction from a senior developer. The schedule is full time Monday through Friday 9-5. 
We definitely packed in the learning with lectures in the morning and time to practice in the afternoon.
